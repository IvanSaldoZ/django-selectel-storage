What is "Django"?
-----------------

It's funny. Of course, you know Django. And know about storage API in Django. Nothing to say here.


What is "Selectel"?
-------------------

Selectel is one of the leading Russian internet hosting operators. Besides a huge number of useful services it provided, would like to say a couple words about Cloud Storage.
It does the same as Amazon's S3, but simpler and cheaper... a bit.

Why "Selectel" cloud?
---------------------

Well, clouds are so cute. Always use it. Also, if your business is located in Russia, you should store sensitive privacy data in Russia, according to some stupid legal acts. Probably, Selectel Cloud Storage is the best choice, because it's relatively cheap and reliable.
